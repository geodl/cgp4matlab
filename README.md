# Cartesian Genetic Programming toolbox for Matlab

This is an implementation of a cartesian genetic programming toolbox for Matlab.

# Get Started

Just include the startup file that is on the root, and you are good to go.

You can follow along with the example of a symbolic regression provided [here](https://github.com/tiagoinacio/cgp4matlab/tree/master/examples/symbolic-regression).
